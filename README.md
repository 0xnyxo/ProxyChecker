# ProxyChecker
**ProxyChecker** is a multithreaded tool that validates HTTP and HTTPS proxies efficiently in real-time. It fetches proxies from a specified URL, checks their validity via test requests, and saves the valid ones to a file. The tool dynamically updates the terminal with real-time results and status updates.
